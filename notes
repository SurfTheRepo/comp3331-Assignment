File to remind me where i currently am up to etc


stuff to still implement:
	1. 3way handshake.  syn, synack, ack.

	2. 4way disconnect. fin, ack, fin, ack
		will come from sender after file transmitted.

	3. timeout operation, which uses RRT-est and RTO est,
		use formula . TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT).
		 Use the initial value of EstimatedRTT = 500 milliseconds and DevRTT = 250 milliseconds.

	4. Sender need features from sec 3.5.4 excpt doublin the timeout

	5. receiver uses 3.5.4features. do immediate packet acks

	6. inc sequence number and ack number in header of segments

	7. Need a maxSegSize, which is max size of data, w/o header

	8. Max window size, field for sender. max number of unACk
		bytes that sender can have at a time. ie need to wait
		for bytes to be acked before sending more,
		can resend tho.

	--DONT NEED FLOW OR CONGESTION CONTROL


	Segment header:
		- up to me, defs need seq and ack nums, flags.
